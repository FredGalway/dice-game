# Game rules :
# The game includes 2 players on a single desktop version screen or simultaneously on the mobile version.
# Each player has a temporary score (in green) and an overall score in large size.
# At each turn, the player has his temporary score initialized to 0 and can roll a die as many times as he wishes.
# The result of a throw is added to the temporary score. During his turn, the player can decide at any time to:
# Click on the "Roll dice" option to increase the temporary score. If he rolls a 1, the temporary score is lost and his turn ends.
# Click on the “Hold” option, which allows to keep the points. It will then be the other player's turn.
# The first player to reach 100 points wins the game and the trophee!
